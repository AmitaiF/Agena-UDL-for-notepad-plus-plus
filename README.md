# Agena UDL for Notepad++
## What is it?
It's a file that declares rules for formatting keywords, comments, numbers, and delimiters for the Agena language.
It can be imported to the Notepad++ app.
## Why do we need it?
When I started programming with Agena, I quickly realized that the official editor of Agena isn't comfortable to work with.
I decided to program using Notepad++ instead, but although Notepad++ comes prepackaged with many Language lexers, Agena isn't included in those packages.
So I decided to create my own UDL for Agena!
## How to use it?
1. Download the AgenaUDL.xml file. You can download it as a zip file, or you can clone it:
```
git clone https://github.com/AmitaiF/Agena-UDL-for-notepad-plus-plus.git
````
2. Open Notepad++.
3. On the menu click on ```Language``` > ```Define your language...```
4. Click the ```Import``` button.
5. Select the AgenaUDL.xml file you downloaded.
